Quarto version of the latest version  of the book

"Least Squares Multididimensional Scaling: smacof at 50"

The repository does not include the _book directory, so
there is no pdf. You can get the pdf from
jansweb.netlify.app/publication/deleeuw-b-24-a.pdf.

It also does not have the *_cache directories
and the *_files directories. All the stuff in them
will be generated by quarto/R on your local machine.

I also have not included the binaries for the
shared libraries (*.so). They can be generated with
R CMD SHLIB when you need them.

Binaries (*.jpg, *.png) of the graphics files
not generated by quarto/R are include in the
graphics directory.
