Quarto version of the latest version  of the book

"Least Squares Multididimensional Scaling: smacof at 50"

The repository does not include the _book directory
(so no pdf). It also does not have the *_cache directories
and the *_files directories. All the stuff in them
will be generated by quarto/R on your local machine.
The pdf of the book is available on my website.

There is also no Rproj file for the quarto book.
But all the ingredients are there.

I also have not included the binaries of the
shared libraries. They can be generated with
R CMD SHLIB when you need them.

Binaries (*.jpg, *.png) of the graphics files
not generated by quarto/R are include in the
graphics directory.
